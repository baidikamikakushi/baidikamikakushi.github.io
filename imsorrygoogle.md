My name is Christoph Weidemann. My Twitter Account was @quantum4free

- it was a great honor to be google administrator
- i couldnt handle it and got a nervoous brakdown
- after that it become a manic episode
- i had no control over myself and was posting alot of stuff what was the reason u demoted me
- it was the biggest mistake in my life
- im living from social welfaire and im severely disabled, i will get no such change in life for a second time
- im deeply sorry please do not further investigate and bring me to curt
in the end i do not know what else i can say
In the beginning i felt some how googly like in the movie with ben stiller but in the end its only depression

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RHAurRXQc&t=108s) and it will answer **all** your questions. Its in german. About modern Psychiatry and their mesures how they treat patients.
